#### Advice from another adult beginner who is slightly ahead of you in the Suzuki violin books, but who is enjoying her adult music lessons over at the YMCA just fine.

It almost feels clique to say this, but it seems like everyone has been doing
software these days.  (["Everyone has been doing emails."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNFI5SUhqLs)).  As someone who
not so unrecently took the plunge into software development, I've been
getting a lot of questions from people who are considering doing the
same.  If that's you, this is my advice.

So yes, you’re thinking about programming?  That’s awesome.  It’s really
a great gig.  Lot’s of opportunity in that sector.  It can be a super
satisfying and creative thing to do.  Yada yada. Which you should
definitely do it.  (Really though, **do eet**!)
That is, if you really want to do it.

Which brings me to my first piece of advice:

> Do not decide that you’re going to do this right now.

Especially if you don’t have any experience programming in
college/whatever, you owe it to yourself to like give yourself a little
breathing room here to figure out if this is really the right move for you.  And like,
also a little room for the possibility that this is not at all the right
move for you.  I think a lot of people come to programming these days from
something else that they hate.  Bootcamps’ marketing departments do a
great job of building this escapist,
everything-will-be-awesome-if-you-just-give-us-money-and-come-here-for-eight-weeks
mentality around their programs.  But the truth is, programming could
turn out to be
a *terrible* career choice for you if your heart’s not in it; like possibly worse
than that boring job you have now.

"Why is that?" you ask.  For one thing, it’s hard, and (at least in my limited
experience) keeps being hard.  My co-worker recently pointed out that
the "development" in "software development" means that you're always *developing* something you've
never *developed* before, meaning you're always reaching into uncharted conceptual territory.  So the idea isn't that you're going to acquire a
skillset and use it to build things over and over again, rather it's that you're going to
acquire the skillset of acquiring new skillsets, and use that to continually
do stuff you've never done before. You get me?  

So it's way more about continually dealing with
not knowing stuff (i.e. humility, learning), than about knowing stuff
and being like,”Wow, so cool, rad, this is awesome, I’m awesome.”

I was a musician before I was a programmer, so I kind of tend to see starting out in programming in
relation to starting a new
musical instrument — just like there are like crazy virtuoso musicians
who’ve been at it since birth, so too are there crazy virtuoso
programmers who have been at it since apple’s logo had a raindow on it.
And there’s like a similar amount of ground to cover between not being
good at [violin|programming] and being good at [violin|programming].

So let’s actually just run with this comparison and reframe this
discussion a little bit — imagine you woke up tomorrow morning and decided that you
wanted to become a concert violinist.  That’s awesome!  Really cool.
But making that happen means that you’re going to really suck at playing
the violin.  Like really suck.  And probably in your lifetime you might
not really make it to the level of someone who’s been doing it since
they were like 4 or 5.

I think starting programming is a lot like being an adult beginner in
music lessons.  Except the only difference is that there is no surplus
of talented violinist roles in our economy, but there *is* such a surplus
of programming roles for the time being.  So the playing field is
advantageous for people who want to pick up a laptop and start
screeching out their first Ode to Code.

So but music analogies aside, at the end of the day, if it turns out that *programming is not very
interesting to you* in the first place, then you might be talking about
trading a boring and (maybe) manageable job for boring and very
difficult one that you’re necessarily going to suck at for a very long
time and will have to work and stuggle constantly to get better at.  Maybe not the
best trade.

So but the point is, for now, just have an open mind and see how much
serotonin gets released in your brain when you get your first
tic-tac-toe game to run.  The pressure’s off -- have some fun with it!

And here's how I suggest having that fun:

**1. Pick a programming language to focus on.** Unless you have a pretty clear
   picture of what you want to do/where you want to
   work, this will be a pretty arbitrary
   decision.  Try not to get too hung up on trying to pick the right language.  I
   think it's helpful to limit yourself to one language while you're getting your
   bearings, but all of the concepts you'll be learning are transferable
   between languages, so in no way will you be like locking yourself into
   anything.  Actually, the opposite is true -- learning your first
   programming language will make learning a second one way easier.  If
   you're having some trouble deciding, let the following Harry Potter Sorting Hat
  Quiz™ guide your decision:

  With which of the following Hogwarts houses do you most closely identify?

  a) Slitherin

  b) Hufflepuff

  c) Ravenclaw

  d) What's that? (Muggle)

  **Results**

  | You answered... | Go with: |
  | --------------- | ------- |
  | a.              | Javascript
  | b.              | Ruby
  | c.              | Python
  | d.              | PHP
  <p></p>

**2. Create a free account over at
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).** Complete the tracks for the
following topics:

- The programming language you chose in Step 1
- HTML & CSS
- Javascript (no need to repeat if that's what you chose in step 1)
- jQuery
- Learn the Command Line
- Learn SQL
- Learn Git

There's also some fun activities on codecademy, so feel free to take
detours.  Remember, the goal here is fun.  Try to commit an hour or two
to this each day until you're finished if you can.

**3. Create an account over at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/)**.
Join some groups for the language you chose in Step 1, as well as any
other that interest you.  Start going to meetups every week.  Force
yourself to talk to people, even if that's not your thing.  This is an
opportunity to take the temporature of the community you're thinking
about joining.  Ask around about learning
resources, get peoples' takes on bootcamps in your area, if that's
something you're considering, etc.  Also, if you're super stuck on
something (e.g. installing Rails), there's a good
chance that someone here can help you.

<p></p>
-> **Pause**.  Ask yourself: "Do I like this?  Am I having fun?" <-
* * *
<p></p>
If your answered yes, then fun is over!  Jk, you can still have
fun with it.  But...

**4. The next step is to turn up the resistence a little bit on your self study.**  I would suggest getting
   a paid subscription to either [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) or [Codeschool](https://teamtreehouse.com/) (or both!).  Whereas
   codecadey's a great way to hit the ground running, these
   sites provide a combination of slightly more in-depth video lectures
   and exercises.  After signing up, go through the course
   material offered for the language you've chosen as well as all of the topics
   listed in Step 2.  There will be some redundancy here, but that's actually a good thing.

**5. The next step is to tackle a framework.**  Here's where we're starting
to get a little more specific.  If a programming language is like
legos, a framework is like a specific lego set -- it's good at
building a particular thing.  That being said, I think it's still
the case that learning about one will make learning a second one
easier.

* * *
<p></p>
-> **Pause**.  Ask yourself: "Even though this is frustrating sometimes
and stuff's usually broken, can I see myself making a career out of
perpetually dealing with this brokenness?" <-
* * *
<p></p>

**6. Partially quit your job.** If you've started digging into codeschool/treehouse and are still
stoked on this idea, then you need to think about freeing up some
time to pursue this.  If it's at all possible to cuver your expenses
working part time, that's a great option.  Start to treat
programming like a second job -- go to a coffeeshop and do it for
four hours a day every day. 

> Try to cut down to working part time and start devouring online
> resources as a second part time job for three to six months.
Like I’m not kidding, coffee shop every day for four hours.  Be that
person.  Order a Macciato.  Stake out a spot next to the outlet.  Go
there every day.  Work at it hard.

    This should be the big jump, not the jump into a bootcamp.

  7. Decide whether to take the bootcamp route or to go it alone.

I think it’s really important to realize that coding bootcamps are
businesses.  No matter how approachable they are or much eye contact
they make with you or how often they tell you they love you, they don’t
necessarily have your best interests in mind.  But what they *do*
necessarily have in mind, as a *business*, is their *own* best
interests.  That said, what bootcamps have going for them is that they
can help you cover a ton of ground quickly.   They do this by taking
care of the parts of programming that would be the costliest/least
beneficial to you at this point (i.e. setting up your environment and
dealing with configuration) and then force feeding you a ton of material
about a specific language and framework.  You’re paying for the benefit
of not getting stuck for too long on things that aren’t that important
for your learning in this moment.  And also for curriculum.  

Another way they function is that they hold a substantial wager that you
make on yourself succeeding.  Once you've paid them

As much as they try to market their programs as no-brainer money back
decisions, deciding to enroll in a bootcamp at its heart is a cold,
practical, financial decision.  Be skeptical of job guarantees — you’re
going to have to hustle to find a job and one way or another you’re
going to be putting a ton of time and money on the line for this
decision.  So just be skeptical, kick the tires, ask for a tours,
realize they’ll be less nice to you once they have your money.  

And then maybe, on your own terms, as part of your own realistic
narrative, if pouring over hours and hours of lessons and struggling to
get things set up hasn’t completely put you off to the whole thing, and
if you decide you need the leaning boost, then maybe that’d be the time.
