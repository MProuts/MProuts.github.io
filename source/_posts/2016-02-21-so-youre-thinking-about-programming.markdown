#### Advice from another adult beginner who is slightly ahead of you in the Suzuki violin books, but who is enjoying her adult music lessons over at the YMCA just fine.

It almost feels clique to say this, but it seems like everyone has been doing
software these days.  (["Everyone has been doing emails."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNFI5SUhqLs)).  As someone who
not so unrecently took the plunge into software development, I've been
getting a lot of questions from people who are considering doing the
same.  If that's you, this is my advice.

So yes, you’re thinking about programming?  That’s awesome.  It’s really
a great gig.  Lot’s of opportunity in that sector.  It can be super
satisfying and creative and interesting and lucrative.  Yada yada. You should
definitely do it.  (Seriously, **do eet**!)
That is, if you really want to do it.

Which brings me to my first piece of advice:

> Do not decide that you’re going to do this right now.

Especially if you don’t have any experience programming in
college/whatever, you owe it to yourself to like give yourself a little
breathing room here to figure out if this is really the right move for you.  And like,
also a little room for the possibility that this is not at all the right
move for you.  I think a lot of people come to programming these days from
something else that they hate.  Bootcamps’ marketing departments do a
great job of building this escapist,
everything-will-be-awesome-if-you-just-give-us-money-and-come-here-for-eight-weeks
mentality around their programs.  But the truth is, programming could
turn out to be
a *terrible* career choice for you if your heart’s not in it; like possibly worse
than that boring job you have now.

"Why is that?" you ask.  Well for one thing, it’s hard, and (at least in my limited
experience) keeps being hard.  My co-worker recently pointed out that
the "development" in "software development" implies that you're always *developing* something you've
never *developed* before, meaning you're always reaching into new conceptual territory.  So the idea isn't that you're going to acquire a
skillset and use it to build things over and over again, rather it's that you're going to
acquire the skillset of acquiring new skillsets, and use that to continually
do stuff you've never done before. You get me?  

So it's way more about continually dealing with
not knowing stuff (i.e. humility, learning), than about knowing stuff
and being like,”Wow, so cool, rad, this is awesome, I’m awesome.”

I was a musician before I was a programmer, so I kind of tend to see starting out in programming in
relation to starting a new
musical instrument — just like there are crazy virtuoso musicians
who’ve been at it since birth, so too are there crazy virtuoso
programmers who have been at it since apple’s logo had a raindow on it.
And there’s like a similar amount of ground to cover between not being
good at [violin|programming] and being good at [violin|programming].

So let’s actually just run with this comparison and reframe this
discussion a little bit — imagine you woke up tomorrow morning and decided that you
wanted to become a concert violinist.  That’s awesome!  Really cool.
But making that happen means that you’re going to really suck at playing
the violin.  Like really suck.  And probably in your lifetime you might
not really make it to the level of someone who’s been doing it since
they were like 4 or 5.

I think starting programming is a lot like being an adult beginner in
music lessons.  Except the only difference is that there is no surplus
of talented violinist roles in our economy, but there *is* such a surplus
of programming roles for the time being.  So the playing field is
advantageous for people who want to pick up a laptop and start
screeching out their first Ode to Code.

So but music analogies aside, at the end of the day, if it turns out that *programming is not very
interesting to you* in the first place, then you might be talking about
trading a boring and (maybe) manageable job for boring and very
difficult one that you’re necessarily going to suck at for a very long
time and will have to work and stuggle constantly to get better at.  Maybe not the
best trade.

So but *the point is*, for now, just have an open mind and see how much
serotonin gets released in your brain when you get your first
tic-tac-toe game to run.  The pressure’s off -- have some fun with it!

And here's how I suggest having that fun:

**1. Pick a programming language to focus on.** Unless you have a pretty clear
   picture of what you want to do/where you want to
   work, this will be a pretty arbitrary
   decision.  Try not to get too hung up on trying to pick the right language.  I
   think it's helpful to limit yourself to one language while you're getting your
   bearings, but all of the concepts you'll be learning are transferable
   between languages, so in no way will you be like locking yourself into
   anything.  Actually, the opposite is true -- learning your first
   programming language will make learning a second one way easier.  If
   you're having some trouble deciding, let the following Harry Potter Sorting Hat
  Quiz™ guide your decision:

  With which of the following Hogwarts houses do you most closely identify?

  a) Slitherin

  b) Hufflepuff

  c) Ravenclaw

  d) What's that?

  **Results**

  | You answered... | Go with: |
  | --------------- | ------- |
  | a.              | Javascript
  | b.              | Ruby
  | c.              | Python
  | d.              | PHP
  <p></p>

**2. Create a free account over at
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).** Complete the tracks for the
following topics:

- \<Programming Language from Step 1\>
- HTML & CSS
- Javascript (no need to repeat if you're from house Slitherin)
- jQuery
- Learn the Command Line
- Learn SQL
- Learn Git

There's also some fun activities on Codecademy, so feel free to take
detours.  Remember, the goal here is to have fun.  Try to commit an hour or two
to this each day until you're finished if you can.

**3. Create an account over at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/)**.
Join some groups for the language you chose in Step 1, as well as any
others that interest you.  Start going to meetups every week.  Force
yourself to talk to people, even if that's not your thing.  This is an
opportunity to take the temperature of the community you're thinking
about joining.  Ask around about learning
resources, get peoples' takes on bootcamps in your area (if that's
something you're considering), etc.  Also, if you're super stuck on
something (e.g. installing Rails), there's a good
chance that someone here can help you.

* * *
<p></p>
-> **Pause**.  Ask yourself: "Do I like this?  Am I having fun?" <-
* * *
<p></p>
If your answered yes, then fun is over!  Jk, you can still have
fun.  However...

**4. The next step is to turn up the resistence a little bit on your self study.**  I would suggest getting
   a paid subscription to either [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) or [Codeschool](https://teamtreehouse.com/), or both.  Whereas
   codecadey's a great way to hit the ground running, these
   sites provide a combination of slightly more in-depth video lectures
   and exercises.  After signing up, go through the course
   material offered for the language you've chosen, as well as all of the topics
   listed in Step 2.  There will be some redundancy here, but that's actually a good thing.  Really binge on these resources.

**5. The next step is to tackle a framework.**  "What's a framework?"
you ask.  If a programming language is like a big bin of general-purpose
lego pieces, a framework is like a specific lego set that is intended to
build a specific thing, e.g. a website.  (Not my analogy, but it's a good
one.) So, now that you have a general grasp of a *programming language*,
you're going to start learning the corresponding *web framework*, which is
a collection of tools written in that language that you can use to make
a website.


| Language   | Framework |  Resources |
| --------   | --------- | --------- |
| Javascript | Meteor.js | [Start here](http://joshowens.me/getting-started-with-meteor-js/)
| Ruby       | Rails     | [Start here](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)
| Python     | Django    | [Start here](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/)
| PHP        | Laravel   | [Start here](https://laravel.com/docs/4.2/quick)
<p></p>

Definitely start going to meetups for the framework you're learning.
Getting frameworks installed can be a nightmare, so do your best to
figure things out yourself (Google is your friend), but limit the amount of time
you spend chasing around configuration errors (to like an hour or two).  If you're really stuck
on something, take a break.  Ask the internet, or go to a meetup and ask someone there.
While you're waiting for help, you can always work on something else.
Oh, and the website you subscribed to in Step 4 probably has some
content related to your framework, so definitely go through those
lectures as well.

By the end of this stage, you should have a framework installed on your
computer and have followed a tutorial to make some basic website that can save and
delete stuff from a database (like a microblog or a todo list) using
that framework.  Again, redundancy is your friend, so if you find a second "Getting Started"
tutorial for your framework, do it!  Having multiple authors'
commentaries will help reenforce all of the new concepts you're
learning.

* * *
<p></p>
-> **Pause**.  Ask yourself: "Even though this is frustrating sometimes
and stuff's often broken, can I see myself making a career out of
perpetually dealing with stuff being broken?" <-
* * *
<p></p>
If your answered yes, then shit's about to get real.  I suggest
you...

**6. Partially quit your job.** If you're digging into Codeschool/Treehouse, going to meetups, and are starting to build stuff with a framework and are *still
stoked on this idea*, then you need to think about freeing up some more
time in your schedule for staring blankly at stack traces in the console.

If it's at all possible to cover your expenses
working part time, that's a great option.  Start to treat
programming like a second job -- go to a coffeeshop and do it for
four hours a day, every day.  You shouldn't have any trouble coming up
with topics to study.  Figure out how the unix file system works,
chose a text editor and start trying to master it, set up a cute bash
prompt.

This step (not enrolling in a bootcamp) should be
where the big jump takes place.  Start thinking of yourself as a
programmer and doing this all the time.  Commit to this. Remember, even
when you're stuck, you're learning.
Even when it feels like you're not moving, you are.  Don't get
frustrated -- you got this.

**7. Decide whether to take the bootcamp route or to go it alone.**

Let's start this section off with a simple fact:
Bootcamps are businesses.  That means that no matter how approachable they seem, or much
eye contact they make, or how often they tell you that they love you, they don’t
necessarily have your best interests in mind.  And what they *do*
necessarily have in mind, at the end of the *day*, as a *business*, in
this crazy game we call *capitalism*, are their *own* best interests.  So just keep that in mind.

That said, what bootcamps have going for them is that they
can help you cover a ton of ground quickly.   They do this by taking
care of the parts of programming that would be the costliest/least
beneficial to you at this point in your programming career (i.e. setting
up your environment and dealing with configuration problems) and then force
feeding you a ton of material about a specific language and framework in
a short period of time, all with 24-hour roadside assistance.  You’re
paying for the benefit of not getting stuck for too long on anything.
And also for a nice big buffet of curriculum (so that you don't have to
wonder about whether you're spanding your time wisely or not.)

Another way they function is that they can help you place a
significant wager on your own success as a programmer.  Once you
quit your job and give them a big old chunk of your
savings account, it's sort of imperitive that you slog through it and make it
out the other end.

As much as their marketing departments will try to inflate you with
romanticized notions of progress and success whilst shrouding risks with
money-back guarantees, deciding to enroll in a bootcamp should be a
cold, precise, financial decision.  You're paying for a service.  Be
skeptical of placement promises — you’re going to have to hustle to find a job,
and one way or another you’re going to be putting a ton of time and
money on the line for this service.  And if they do find you a job, just
remember that they take a big old bite out of your first year's salary
as a thank you to themselves.

So be skeptical, ask for a tours, kick the tires.  Remember that this is
just a vehicle to transport you from point A to point B at lightning
speed, and that when you reach point B, you're still more or less on
your own to find a job.

Oh, and this might relate more to the program I went to, but I wouldn't
be surprised if it was generalizable across most similar bootcamp
programs:  namely, the intensity was unlike anything I've
experienced in kindergarten through Pomona.  It was
12 hour days, 6-7 days a week, working your brain to the bone.  Stem?
Whatever.  Think finals for twice the number of classes for two
months straight.  This isn't meant to discourage you -- some people
thrive in intensity.  But intense it will be.  Just something to keep in
mind.

And maybe you decide the bootcamp thing is not for you.  Maybe you'd
rather take your time, maybe you'd rather save your money.  It's totally
possible to get into programming without a bootcamp.  It's just maybe a
little harder and less supported.  And it might take longer.   I'm guessing.
But people do it every day, even. (Or even, every day there are people
who are doing it.)

In the absense of a heavy cash deposit, you may need to perform a little
extra legwork to keep your dream tethered to reality.  But if you can
keep your cool when things break, and find some support when you're
really stuck, and stick to a super strict part-time/full-time job
schedule, then there are free resources available to learn anything
tech-related under the sun.  (The internet sun.)

Ok, so get thee to a coffeeshop!
