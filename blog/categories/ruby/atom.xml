    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This came up while I was doing a refactoring that reached across
multiple files.  I wanted a way to make some change, then run all of the
tests that contain any reference to a particular method.</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>

<p>Replace <code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code> with your search term.</p>

<p><code>sh
ack &lt;pattern&gt; test/ -l | xargs -I{} ruby -I"lib:test" {}
</code></p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>To break this apart a little bit, I knew that you can get <code>ack</code> to give you
a list of file names that match a pattern by passing it the <code>-l</code> option.
So that first clause is pretty straightforward &mdash; look for <code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code>
inside files in the <code>test/</code> directory, and give me back a list of file
names.</p>

<p><code>sh
ack &lt;pattern&gt; test/ -l
</code></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m used to using this command to run a single test:</p>

<p><code>sh
TEST=&lt;filepath&gt; rake test
</code></p>

<p>However, in order to get this working with <code>xargs</code>, I had to switch to the slighlty
uglier version (which, if you look, is what rake is doing internally
anyway):</p>

<p><code>sh
ruby -I"lib:test" &lt;filepath&gt;
</code></p>

<p><code>xarg</code>&rsquo;s <code>-I</code> argument basically just lets you specify where an
argument fits inside shell command that&rsquo;s receiving
it.  In this case, <code>{}</code> in <code>ruby -I"lib:test" {}</code> gets replaced once in
succession by each of the file names we found in the first clause
with <code>ack</code>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given an ActiveRecord class with a has_many association&hellip;</p>

<p><code>ruby
class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :records
  ...
end
</code></p>

<p>&hellip;this is a mistake.</p>

<p><code>ruby
user = User.first
user.records.none?
</code></p>

<p>Why, you ask?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s step back for a second.  On a less-abstract level, the correct way to answer the
question, &ldquo;Are there any records that belong to this user?&rdquo; is to
fire a SQL statement with a <code>SELECT count(*)</code> clause, and see whether the result is
greater than 0.  That&rsquo;s what we want to have happen behind the scenes.</p>

<p>However, that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening when we call <code>none?</code>, because
<code>none?</code> is not defined on <code>ActiveRecord::Relation</code> (the
fancy/magical Rails class that is responsible for abstracting away cross-table SQL queries), but rather, it is
defined on the plain old Ruby module <code>Enumerable</code>.</p>

<p>So, what you might assume (as I did) is doing something smart and
reasonable (i.e.
performing a SQL count, and comparing the result with zero), is actually
doing something <strong>VERY</strong> stupid (i.e. loading a ton of Ruby objects into memory
and performing a count on them there).  You can imagine that if users had thousands of
records each, this line could constitutes a serious resource drain for your application.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<blockquote><p>Know thy <code>ActiveRecord::Relation</code> methods.</p></blockquote>

<p>The method you were probably reaching for was <code>ActiveRecord::Relation#empty?</code>, which
performs a SQL count().  For reference, here&rsquo;s a breakdown of some other
count-related methods on <code>Enumerable</code> and their <code>ActiveRecord::Relation</code> counterparts.</p>

<table>

<th> Question </th>
<th> Enumberable Method </th>
<th> ActiveRecord::Relation Method</th>

<tbody>

<td> <strong>Zero</strong> objects in collection? </td>
<td> <code>none?</code> </td>
<td> <code>empty?</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td> <strong>More than one</strong> object in collection? </td>
<td> <code>x</code> </td>
<td> <code>many?</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td> <strong>Exactly one</strong> object the collection?   </td>
<td> <code>one?</code> </td>
<td> <code>x</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
